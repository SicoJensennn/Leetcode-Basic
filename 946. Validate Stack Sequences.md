### 946. Validate Stack Sequences

```python
class Solution:
	def validateStackSequences(self, pushed: List[int], popped: List[int]) -> bool:
        j = 0
        while len(pushed) > 0 and j < len(pushed):
            if pushed[j] != popped[0]:
                j += 1
            else:
                popped.pop(0)
                pushed.pop(j)
                if j > -1:
                    j -= 1

        return False if len(popped)!=0 else True
```

Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)

Principle: j pointer in pushed always compared with the index 0 of popped array. 

Once we find the same num, removing this num from both arrays, and the j pointer - 1 (to ensure j pointer back to the front of "same num").  When the loop ends, if popped array is empty, then True.
